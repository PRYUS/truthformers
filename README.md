## Abstract of our paper submitted to Factify'22:

There has been a dramatic increase in the spread of misinformation and fake news since the growing sophistication in online communications. Despite the development of numerous fact-checking frameworks and models in research, fake news continues to be the primary concern, especially on social media platforms. Being able to identify false claims based on document references can mitigate the spreading of unverified news. We present a multi-modal fact-verification model which processes a claim data pair and corresponding verified documents to determine the claim's legitimacy. The proposed model uses both text and image content of claims and the documents to determine the level of support provided by the document for the given claim. We make use of Transformer based models for effective processing of the different modalities and use a fusion block for identifying cross-modal representations that embed combined information of the considered modalities from both claim and document to get the final predictions. Our solution ranked number three with a weighted F1-score of 0.7486. The code is available at https://github.com/pryus/truthformers.
